\section{Implementation}
\subsection{Development environment}
BauWatch has git repository templates for commonly used programming languages. These templates contain a standardised directory structure along with configuration
files for the Gitlab code pipelines. This makes it easy to start a project and immediately get started with a basic environment to run linters, documentation
generators and automatic tests.
%TODO Maybe add something about the tools used? These are gitlab (CI), GNU Make, golang tools, Docker. Might be useful to describe testing

\subsection{httprouter}
I use httprouter

\subsection{YAML}
Maybe part of template part but should be mentioned around here

\subsection{Template implementation}

Struct, interactions between templates
Describe how template stacking works
