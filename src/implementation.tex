\chapter{Implementation}
\section{Development environment}
BauWatch has git repository templates for commonly used programming languages. These templates contain a standardized directory structure along with configuration
files for the Gitlab code pipelines. This makes it easy to start a project and immediately get started with a basic environment to run linters, documentation
generators and automatic tests.
%TODO Maybe add something about the tools used? These are gitlab (CI), GNU Make, golang tools, Docker. Might be useful to describe testing

\section{httprouter}
I use httprouter

%\section{Parameters not in parent}
%Parameters can optionally be overridden by the base templates children. This is implemented using a map.
%An issue arises when in child 2 param c is added. That param is not defined in child 1 or the base template.
%How can this param be set in the first place?
%Guard against this in the model and disallow adding parameters through the webpanel.
%Additionally the base template should be initialized from some presupplied default, be it yaml or constants.
