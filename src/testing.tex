\chapter{Testing}
Tests to be conducted:
Unit tests
System test

Some reports about test coverage can be added in here along with how unit tests were implemented.

System tests will list what requirements they test, what the test procedure is and what the result was.
These system tests will be done in the last week to most closely resemble the state of the system.
