\chapter{Testing}
In order to verify the correct operation of the system it has been subjected to automatic unit tests and manual system tests.
The unit tests are automatically executed using the Go testing framework each time a commit is made to the git repository
As stated in the continuous integration section are a requirement before a pull request can be merged.
While the implementation of the prototype is not fully complete at the time of writing the expectation is that all unit tests pass at the end of the project and at that time a coverage report will be shown here indicating what is and isn't covered by the unit tests.

\section{System test}
System tests will list what requirements they test, what the test procedure is and what the result was.
These tests are used to determine if all requirements have been satisfied.
These system tests will be done in the last week to most closely resemble the state of the system.

System tests will be defined with the following information: a short name indicating the purpose of the test, a test description, a list of requirements being tested, and the results of the test.
